# CodeClauseInternship_Breast_Cancer_Classification_DeepLearning
This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning model for classifying breast cancer using histopathological images. The goal of this project is to provide an accurate and efficient tool for assisting in the diagnosis of breast cancer from microscopic images of tissue biopsies.

# Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to analyze histopathological images of breast tissue to distinguish between malignant and benign cases.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is obtained from Dataset Source (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images). It contains a diverse collection of annotated breast histopathology images. The dataset is preprocessed and organized into training, validation, and test sets.
